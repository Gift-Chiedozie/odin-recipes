        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>For the stew base (pepper mix), you can either:</b>
                <p>- Blend your plum tomatoes, red bell peppers, 1 large onion, 3 scotch bonnet peppers,
                    garlic and ginger. Then, boil the blended mixture on medium - high heat till the
                    water is reduced and has thickened significantly to look like a paste; this should
                    take about 20 minutes if placed on high heat.</p>
                <p>OR</p>
                <p>- Cut your tomatoes, peppers, onions, garlic and ginger. Season with a little
                    olive oil and salt. Place in a pan and roast in a preheated oven of 350C for 20 minutes.
                    Blend after</p></li>
            <li>Put water into a pan and place on medium heat. Season with salt and a little oil and allow to boil.</li>
            <li>Add a pack of spaghetti into the boiling water and allow to cook for about 3 -5 minutes just enough to get the starch out</li>
            <li>Drain the spaghetti out of the pasta water and run through cold water.</li>
            <li>In a clean pan or pot, pour your oil and let it heat before throwing your onions, stir until it turns goldeb brown</li>
            <li>Then pour in your blended paste, stir until it changes to a darker colour and coagulates with the oil enough to form a thicker texture, you can taste it to be sure that its not having any sugary taste</li>
            <li>Add your curry, thyme, garlic, onions, salt and seasoning to taste. You can add crayfish of you like</li>
            <li>Add your chicken stock into your pot, and wait for it to boil before adding in your spaghetii, let this boil till your spaghetti has softened, this should take about 20-30mins. Now your spaghetti is ready to be served. Enjoy!</li>
