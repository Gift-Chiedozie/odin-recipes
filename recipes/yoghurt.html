        <ul>
            <li>2 ltrs of milk</li>
            <li>1 cup of granulated sugar or honey</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons of blended cinamon, vanilla or any flavour of choice</li>
            <li>1½ tablespoon of yogurt with bacteria culture in it (e.g. Habib yogurt contains D.V.S culture)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>heat up your pan to medium heat and pour in your milk</li>
                <li>Once hot, remove boiled milk from heat and allow to cool down until it's warm.</li>
                <li>Transfer warm milk into a glass bowl or container (don't use stainless steel because metals can interfere with the bacteria culture in the yogurt)
                    <p><strong>NB:</strong> This draining process will take a couple of hours, so it better to transfer it into the fridge.</p></li>
                <li>Add in your 1½ tablespoons of yogurt with bacteria culture (e.g. Habib yogurt)</li>
                <li>Cover properly with a kitchen towel and keep in a warm place for 6 to 12 hours (or preferably overnight) </li>
                <li>Lastly, put the white firm custard looking yogurt into a cheesecloth (or clean t-shirt or scarf) with a bowl underneath. And allow the excess liquid (whey) to drain out of the yogurt.</li>
                <li>Once the yogurt reaches the consistency you're okay with</li>
                <li>Put it in a bowl, pour in your sugar, or honey. Then add the cinamon or other combination of flavours</li>
                <li>Stir and mix well, refrigerate for 3-6 hours, then it's ready to be served.</li>
            </ol>
