        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>For the stew base (pepper mix), you can either:</b>
                <p>- Blend your plum tomatoes, red bell peppers, 1 large onion, 3 scotch bonnet peppers,
                    garlic and ginger. Then, boil the blended mixture on medium - high heat till the
                    water is reduced and has thickened significantly to look like a paste; this should
                    take about 20 minutes if placed on high heat.</p>
                <p>OR</p>
                <p>- Cut your tomatoes, peppers, onions, garlic and ginger. Season with a little
                    olive oil and salt. Place in a pan and roast in a preheated oven of 350C for 20 minutes.
                    Blend after</p></li>
            <li>Add water to the pot, bring to a boil on low - medium heat. Add salt and a little oil.</li>
            <li>Add a pack of spaghetti and allow to cook for about 8 - 10 minutes. Drain out the
                water from the spaghetti using a colander (sieve). Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat up oil in a pan and sauté onions till it’s translucent.</li>
            <li>Add your pepper mix (as described above), tomato paste
                and chicken stock. Mix well and allow to fry for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste for seasoning and adjust with seasoning cube(s) if needed. Add curry and thyme.</li>
            <li>Add spaghetti into the mixture and mix well for the sauce to get into the spaghetti.
                Fry (stirring occasionally) for about 3 - 5 minutes. And it’s done! Enjoy</li>
